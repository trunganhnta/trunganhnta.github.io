    <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
           <p> Levi has short,
             straight black hair styled in an undercut,
             <br> as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray 
             <br>eyes with dark circles under them and a 
             <br>deceptively youthful face. He is quite short,
             <br> but his physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering 
             <br>equipment usage. He is usually either 
             <br>frowning or expressionless; that, plus his 
             <br>extremely calm demeanor, often makes it 
             <br>difficult for others to guess what he is 
             <br>thinking. He is most often seen in his 
             <br>Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray 
             <br>button up shirt underneath along with his 
             <br>trademark white ascot. When embarking on 
             <br>expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when 
             <br>forced to take leave from his duties due to
             <br> injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain <br>
             white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[citation <br>needed] However, since the beginning of the 
             <br>coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For 
             <br>most of the time during which the Survey 
             <br>Corps were on the run from the military and 
             <br>monarchy, he simply wore his vertical 
             <br>maneuvering equipment harness over casual 
             <br>clothes.[citation needed]</p>
