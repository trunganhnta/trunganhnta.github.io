                    <h1>Levi Ackerman</h1>
                    Levi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut, as well as
                     narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark circles under them and 
                     a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his physique is well-
                     developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment
                      usage. He is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his 
                      extremely calm demeanor, often makes it difficult for others to guess 
                      what he is thinking. He is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform,
                       with a light gray button up shirt underneath along with his trademark 
                       white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also 
                       wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take
                        leave from his duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, 
                        plain white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[citation needed] However, 
                        since the beginning of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off.
                         For most of the time during which the Survey Corps were on the run 
                         from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical
                          maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.[citation needed]
